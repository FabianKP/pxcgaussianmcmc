Proximal MCMC for constrained Gaussians
=======================================

This is an implementation of the [proximal MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07471) method for sampling from linearly constrained
multivariate normal distributions.

TODO
----

1. Update mathematical documentation.
2. Write nice README.
