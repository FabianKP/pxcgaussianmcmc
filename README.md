Proximal MCMC for constrained Gaussians
=======================================

This is an implementation of the [proximal MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07471) method for sampling from linearly constrained
multivariate normal distributions.

For a high-level mathematical documentation, see [here]().


TODO
----

1. Write mathematical documentation.
2. Make a demo-case.
3. Implement outer loop (MCMC).
4. Implement inner loop (proximal operator).
