Proximal MCMC for constrained Gaussians
=======================================

This is an implementation of the [proximal MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07471) method for sampling from linearly constrained
multivariate normal distributions.

For a high-level mathematical documentation, see [here]().


TODO
----

12. Create improved interface. Let user handle the sampling. In return, don't have to implement autotune.
